SRXML - Simple Ruby XML
=========================
  
SRXML is a very (super, if you will!) lightweight xml generator for Ruby. No big magic here, it simply uses method_missing to create the tags. There is some plan to make it more useful. For Example being able to parse existing files etc. but there are probably better libraries to do that.
If you simply want to create an xml file without the need for extra fancy formatting, SRXML could just be the deal for you!

Short Example (from examble.rb):
==================================
   
  require "sr_xml"

  xml = SRXML::XML.new

  xml.projects{
    xml.project("project #1", :description => "some text", :id => 1){
      xml.something_else "yo!"
    }
  }

  puts xml.to_s
    

Will output the following:
  
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><projects><project description="some text" id="1">project #1<something_else>yo!</something_else></project></projects>

You can also use some simple formatting:
  
  puts xml.to_s(:formatted)
    
Which will then give you something like this:
  
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><projects>
  <project description="some text" id="1">project #1
  <something_else>yo!</something_else>
  </project>
  </projects>
